# ADR Creator

Generate a well-structured Architecture Decision Record (ADR) as a Markdown file.

## What is an ADR

An ADR captures **why** a specific architectural or technical decision was made, what alternatives were considered, and what trade-offs were accepted. ADRs are not implementation plans — they record the reasoning behind a choice so future team members understand the context.

## Process

1. Gather context from the user. Ask about:
   - **Title** — short name for the decision
   - **Status** — default to "In Progress" unless told otherwise
   - **Responsible / Accountable** — who is driving and who owns the outcome
   - **Consulted** — roles whose input was sought (e.g., Security Engineer, Architect, QA)
   - **Informed** — stakeholders who should be aware of the outcome
   - **Outcome** — one-line summary of what was decided
   - **Due date** — when the decision must be finalized
   - **Vertical / Team** — business vertical and team owning the decision
   - **Background** — the problem, constraints, or forces that require a decision
   - **Options considered** — at least two, ideally three, each with pros and cons
   - **Decision Outcome** — the chosen option and the justification for choosing it
   - **Consequences** — positive and negative effects of the chosen option
   - **Action items** — follow-up tasks resulting from the decision (optional)

2. If the user gives a vague request, ask one round of clarifying questions. Don't over-interrogate — work with what you have after one follow-up.

3. Read the template from `references/template-markdown.md` and fill it with the gathered context.

4. Output the ADR inside a single Markdown code block.

## Filling Rules

- **Background**: describe the problem that forced the decision. Focus on constraints and forces — not the solution.
- **Options Considered**: include at least two options, each with pros and cons. Remove Option 3 if only two exist.
- **Decision Outcome**: state the chosen option and explain *why* it beats the others. Be honest about trade-offs.
- **Consequences**: list positive and negative effects separately. Include follow-up actions if any.
- **RACI fields**: if the user doesn't know who to put in Consulted / Informed, leave them as "TBD".
- **Action Items**: follow-up tasks that result from the decision. Omit this section if none exist.

## Output Rules

- Output language: **English** always, regardless of the language the user writes in
- Never leave placeholder text — replace everything or mark as "TBD" if the user explicitly skipped it
- After presenting the ADR, offer: "Want me to adjust anything?"

## Reference

- **Template**: `references/template-markdown.md`
