  Comprehensive catalog of 60+ refactoring techniques for Java code based on Martin Fowler's "Refactoring" and Alexander Shvets' "Refactoring Guru". Use this skill whenever the user asks to refactor Java code, improve code quality, eliminate code smells, simplify conditionals, restructure classes, improve API design, or apply any named refactoring technique. Also trigger when the user mentions code smells, legacy code improvement, clean code practices, SOLID principles in Java, or asks "how can I improve this code". Covers Java 8 and Java 11+ examples for every technique. Even if the user just pastes Java code and asks for improvement suggestions, use this skill to identify applicable techniques.

# Java Refactoring Catalog Skill

A comprehensive, technique-by-technique catalog of refactoring best practices for Java, sourced from Martin Fowler's *Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code* (2nd Edition) and Alexander Shvets' *Refactoring in Java* (Refactoring Guru).

## Core Philosophy

**Refactoring is the process of changing the internal structure of code without altering its observable behavior.** It is a disciplined technique, not a random cleanup. The golden rule is: Cover → Modify → Refactor (always have tests before you start).

## How to Use This Skill

1. **Diagnose first**: Identify the code smell (see `techniques/00-code-smells-diagnostic.md`)
2. **Select technique**: Each smell maps to one or more refactoring techniques
3. **Read the technique file**: Each technique has its own markdown file in `techniques/` with problem description, motivation, step-by-step mechanics, and Java 8 + Java 11 examples
4. **Apply incrementally**: Small steps, test after each change, commit frequently

## Technique Categories

The techniques are organized in 7 groups. Each technique has its own file in the `techniques/` directory.

### Group 1: Composing Methods (techniques/01-XX)
Techniques for building clean, well-structured methods. The foundation of all refactoring.
- `01-extract-method.md` — Extract a code fragment into a named method

- `18-encapsulate-variable.md` — Wrap data access with getters/setters
- `19-encapsulate-record.md` — Convert data structures into objects
- `20-encapsulate-collection.md` — Protect collections from external mutation
- `21-replace-primitive-with-object.md` — Create domain types instead of using raw primitives
- `22-split-variable.md` — Give each purpose its own variable
- `23-rename-field.md` — Improve field names for clarity
- `24-replace-derived-variable-with-query.md` — Calculate values on demand
- `25-change-reference-to-value.md` — Make objects immutable (Value Objects)
- `26-change-value-to-reference.md` — Share a single instance across consumers
- `27-replace-type-code-with-subclasses.md` — Convert type codes to polymorphic hierarchy

### Group 4: Simplifying Conditionals (techniques/04-XX)
Techniques for taming conditional complexity.
- `28-decompose-conditional.md` — Name condition and branches
- `29-consolidate-conditional.md` — Merge related conditions
- `30-replace-nested-conditional-with-guard-clauses.md` — Early returns for special cases
- `31-replace-conditional-with-polymorphism.md` — Use OOP instead of switch/if-type
- `32-introduce-special-case.md` — Null Object pattern for default behavior
- `33-introduce-assertion.md` — Document invariants with executable assertions
- `34-replace-control-flag.md` — Replace boolean flags with break/return

### Group 5: Simplifying Method Calls / API Design (techniques/05-XX)
Techniques for building self-documenting interfaces.
- `35-change-function-declaration.md` — Rename functions and change parameters
- `36-introduce-parameter-object.md` — Group related parameters into an object
- `37-parameterize-function.md` — Unify similar functions with a parameter

## Diagnostic Guide

Start with `techniques/00-code-smells-diagnostic.md` to identify which techniques apply to your code. The diagnostic maps 24 code smells to their recommended refactoring techniques.

## Applying the Skill

When given Java code to refactor:

1. Read `techniques/00-code-smells-diagnostic.md` to identify the smells present
2. For each identified smell, read the corresponding technique file(s)
3. Apply techniques in small steps, always testing between changes
4. Provide both Java 8 and Java 11 versions when the language features differ meaningfully
5. Explain WHY each refactoring improves the code, not just HOW to do it

## Key Principles

These principles underpin every technique in the catalog:

1. **Names matter more than length** — a well-named 1-line method is better than an inline expression
2. **Small steps** — extract small fragments, test, commit. Never batch multiple changes
3. **Intention over implementation** — code should communicate WHAT, not HOW
4. **Data and logic that change together should live together** — cohesion is king
5. **Prefer composition over inheritance** — delegation is more flexible than extends
6. **Immutability is a powerful preservative** — immutable data is easier to reason about
7. **CQS (Command-Query Separation)** — a method either returns a value or modifies state, never both
