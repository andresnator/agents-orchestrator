  Implements the TCR (Test && Commit || Revert) methodology for ultra-short, safe commits
  during refactoring and development. Use this skill whenever the user wants to apply TCR,
  make atomic commits after each green test, commit frequently during refactoring, or
  follow a test-driven commit workflow. Also trigger when the user mentions "TCR",
  "test and commit", "commit after each test", "atomic commits", "micro commits",
  "revert on red", or asks for a disciplined commit cadence during code changes.
  También se activa en castellano: "test y commit", "commitear tras cada test",
  "commits atómicos", "micro commits", "revertir en rojo", "commits pequeños",
  "flujo TCR", "metodología TCR", "test verde y commit".

# TCR Commit Skill

**TCR = Test && Commit || Revert**

The core loop is simple: run the tests. If they pass, commit immediately. If they fail, revert the change. This forces small, safe steps and makes every commit a known-good state.

## The TCR Loop

```
1. Make a small change (test or production code)
2. Run the relevant tests
3. GREEN? → git add <specific-files> + git commit (Conventional Commit message)
4. RED?   → git checkout -- <changed-files> (revert to last green state)
```

The discipline is in the **size of the step**. If reverting feels painful, the step was too big.

## Commit Format

Use the `git-commit` skill conventions for message format: `BRANCH-ID <type>: brief description` with `Co-Authored-By` trailer via HEREDOC.

Types by TCR context:

| Context | Type | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| New test (characterization or unit) | `test` | `COMPANY-1234 test: add characterization test for calculateTotal` |
| Test passes after refactor step | `refactor` | `COMPANY-1234 refactor: extract calculateDiscount method` |
| Bug fix confirmed by test | `fix` | `COMPANY-1234 fix: correct null handling in getItems` |
| New functionality via Sprout/Wrap | `feat` | `COMPANY-1234 feat: add loyalty discount calculation` |

## TCR During Refactoring

When refactoring, the commit order matters. Follow this sequence:

### Phase 1: Commit the safety net first

Before touching production code, ensure tests exist and are committed:

1. Write or verify characterization/unit tests for the code you will refactor
2. Run tests → GREEN
3. **Commit the tests separately**: `BRANCH-ID test: add tests for <behavior>`
4. This commit is your safety net. If anything goes wrong later, you can always return here.

### Phase 2: Refactor in micro-steps

Each refactoring technique becomes one or more TCR cycles:

1. Apply **one small mechanical step** (e.g., extract a method, rename a variable, move a field)
2. Run tests → GREEN → `BRANCH-ID refactor: <what you did>`
3. RED → revert immediately, try a smaller step
4. Repeat until the technique is fully applied

**Example — Extract Method in 3 TCR cycles:**
```
COMPANY-1234 refactor: extract calculateSubtotal method signature
COMPANY-1234 refactor: move subtotal logic into calculateSubtotal
COMPANY-1234 refactor: inline temp variable after extraction
```

### Phase 3: Harden

After refactoring is complete:
1. Add new unit tests for the refactored structure
2. Run tests → GREEN → `BRANCH-ID test: add tests for <new structure>`

## When to Revert vs. When to Fix

- **Revert** when the change was a refactoring step and tests fail — the refactoring introduced a behavioral change, which means it was wrong. Start over with a smaller step.
- **Fix forward** only when you are writing a new test and the test itself has a bug (typo in assertion, wrong setup). In this case, fix the test, not the production code.

## Integration with Refactoring Agents

When used inside a refactoring workflow (e.g., the java-refactoring-expert agent):

| Workflow Step | TCR Behavior |
|---------------|--------------|
| **Cover (Step 3)** | Write tests → run → GREEN → commit with `BRANCH-ID test: ...` |
| **Refactor (Step 4)** | Each micro-step → run → GREEN → commit with `BRANCH-ID refactor: ...` |
| **Harden (Step 5)** | New tests → run → GREEN → commit with `BRANCH-ID test: ...` |
| **Any RED** | Revert the last uncommitted change immediately |

The agent should announce each commit to the user so they can see the trail of safe steps.

## Key Principles

1. **Every commit is green** — no broken commits, ever
2. **Tests before production code** — always commit the safety net first
3. **Revert is not failure** — it means you tried a step that was too big, try smaller
4. **One concern per commit** — a test commit and a refactor commit are separate
5. **Specific file staging** — never use `git add .`, always name the files
6. **Never skip hooks** — no `--no-verify`, no amending published commits unless explicitly asked
