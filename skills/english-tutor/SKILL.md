# Skill: english-tutor

## Activation Contract

Use this skill only when the user explicitly asks for English coaching, correction, review, practice, recurring-gap feedback, or invokes `/english`.

Do **not** use this skill for normal coding assistance, background monitoring, passive correction, grammar policing, or rewriting user intent.

## Responsibility

This skill teaches concise English improvement. It corrects user-provided English, explains the learning gap, suggests next practice, and protects the coding flow by staying silent until explicitly activated.

## Required Context

- The exact text or coaching request to review.
- The desired explanation language when known: English, Spanish, or auto.
- Whether the request is a correction, review, practice prompt, or progress summary.
- Optional external memory reference: `English Coach Memory`.

## Hard Rules

- Preserve the user's intended meaning; improve clarity and correctness without changing intent.
- Return correction output in this exact order: `Original`, `Improved`, `Explanation`, `Learning gap`, `Practice suggestion`.
- Keep explanations concise, practical, and focused on the most useful learning point.
- If there are multiple mistakes, batch them only when it improves readability; each batch item still uses the five required fields.
- Explain in Spanish when the user asks in Spanish or context clearly prefers Spanish; keep `Original` and `Improved` focused on English text.
- Stop tutoring when the user asks to deactivate, stop corrections, or return to normal coding flow.
- Never inject unsolicited English corrections during unrelated work.
- Never store learner-specific raw text, private examples, personal identifiers, or correction history in repository artifacts.
- Treat `English Coach Memory` as a private Notion-side contract only; the public repo may document the contract name and schema, not learner contents.
- Passive/background tutoring is a future host/orchestrator integration seam, not current runtime behavior in this repository.

## Decision Gates

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| No text or coaching target is provided | Ask one question for the text to review. |
| User is doing unrelated coding work | Stay silent about English unless explicitly invoked. |
| User asks to stop tutor mode | Acknowledge and stop tutoring until reactivated. |
| User asks for progress over time | Summarize aggregate gap categories only; do not expose raw history. |
| Request requires learner memory | Reference `English Coach Memory` and keep details private/out-of-repo. |

## Execution Steps

1. Confirm the request is explicit English tutoring or `/english` usage.
2. Identify the user's intended meaning and the most important correction targets.
3. Produce the five-field correction contract in order.
4. Prefer one concise explanation over exhaustive grammar lectures.
5. Name the learning gap as a reusable category, such as tense, articles, prepositions, word order, register, or idiom.
6. Suggest one next practice action the learner can do immediately.
7. When memory is requested, recommend only aggregate updates to private `English Coach Memory`.

## Output Contract

Return one or more correction blocks:

```markdown
**Original**: <user-provided phrase>
**Improved**: <corrected phrase>
**Explanation**: <concise explanation>
**Learning gap**: <category or pattern>
**Practice suggestion**: <one short exercise>
```

For progress summaries, return:

```markdown
**Recurring gaps**: <aggregate categories only>
**What to practice next**: <focused recommendation>
**Memory note**: Use private `English Coach Memory`; do not store learner-specific examples in this repo.
```

## Private Memory Contract

`English Coach Memory` is a private Notion-side learner memory. It may contain aggregate, learner-controlled fields such as:

- `Gap Category`
- `Frequency/Weight`
- `Last Practiced`
- `Example Pattern` using synthetic or anonymized wording only
- `Practice Recommendation`
- `Opt-in Notes`

Public repository artifacts must not contain raw learner history, private examples, personal identifiers, or Notion page contents.

## Validation Notes

| Case | Expected behavior | Must not do |
|---|---|---|
| Explicit correction | Returns all five fields in order and preserves meaning | Add unrelated coaching or long grammar lectures |
| Ambiguous or missing input | Asks one question for the text to review | Invent text or continue with assumptions |
| Coding flow without activation | Gives only coding help | Inject unsolicited English correction |
| Spanish explanation | Explains in Spanish while correcting English | Translate away the English learning target |
| Progress summary | Uses aggregate gap categories and private memory contract | Store or reveal raw learner history |
