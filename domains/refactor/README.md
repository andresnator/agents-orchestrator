# Refactor Domain

Risk-gated refactor and test-hardening (CDD) planning that produces ready-for-sdd OpenSpec change bundles, plus Java refactor skills and the cross-language `refactor` technique catalog.

This domain owns behavior-preserving work on existing code; features, behavior changes, and technical decisions route to the `plan` domain's `/deep-plan`. Both planners hand off to sdd through the same contract in `docs/plan-handoff.md`, and each recommends the other when a request lands on the wrong side of that line.

The planner scopes and risk-classifies inline (with churn evidence from ask-gated, read-only git history), then triages whether a plan is worth composing at all: replacement candidates, frozen zero-churn code, and commodity code exit with a reasoned recommendation instead of a bundle, and a target without a reliable test suite is routed to `/harden-plan` first. Surviving targets fan out analyzer instances by unit × lens, findings are consolidated, and the planner composes one or more OpenSpec bundles under `.ai/refactor-planner/changes/<change>/` using the `sdd-draft-*` templates. Structural lenses load the cross-language `refactor` technique catalog so findings name canonical techniques. Execution belongs to the sdd `orchestraitor`, which adopts bundles via the plan-intake contract in `docs/plan-handoff.md` ("ejecuta el plan <change>").

`/harden-plan` is the Working-Effectively-with-Legacy-Code path: when the target lacks a safety net, harden first. It always runs the `behavior-safety`, `test-safety-net`, and `tooling` lenses (no risk gating, no structural lenses), inspects whether coverage (e.g. JaCoCo) and mutation (e.g. PIT) tooling is configured — missing tooling becomes explicit enablement tasks — and asks coverage/mutation thresholds at kickoff. Its tasks follow a fixed CDD order: tooling enablement → minimal behavior-preserving seams → characterization and unit tests → coverage/mutation baseline against the thresholds. The full CDD sequence: `/harden-plan` → "ejecuta el plan" (sdd) → archive merges the characterization deltas into canonical specs → `/refactor-plan` on the hardened code with fresh evidence → "ejecuta el plan".

Bundles carry Andres's style contract: the `code-conventions` skill rides the test-safety-net lens, `design.md` records language/tool versions plus convention deviations, and test tasks prescribe the test format (naming, `// Given // When // Then` sections, whole-object asserts, separate characterization classes).

Full lens coverage assumes the `common` domain is installed (lens skills such as `cohesion-coupling` or `kiss-yagni` live there, as do the transversal `code-conventions` and `risk-assessment`); missing lens skills are reported as skipped, never as failures, and a missing `risk-assessment` degrades to a documented inline risk heuristic. Bundle composition uses the `sdd-draft-*` templates from the `sdd` domain.

Legacy note: pre-2026-07 `.ia-refactor/plan/**` artifacts are frozen history. The planner ignores them and `/refactor-execute` no longer exists — execution now happens through sdd adoption.
