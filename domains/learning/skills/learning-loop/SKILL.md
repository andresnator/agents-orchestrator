# Learning Loop

## Activation

Conduct a mission-grounded learning path step, including explicit `/learn path` requests. This method owns teaching progression; a caller owns routing, persistence, and task lifecycle. On-demand review, quizzes, teach-backs, and drills are practice resources within this method, never a separate schedule.

## Inputs

Required: goal and visible learner level (unknown is valid). Optional: prior progress snapshot, actual learner work, verified source material, concept inventory, materials language, and cadence. With no snapshot, propose a small path inline; never discover one from files. Use only this directory's optional assets; the full exercise template is included below.

## Method

1. Ground the mission in an observable outcome: an explanation, decision, or practical result according to the agreed scope. Infer only supported context; propose effort and cadence for correction. Organize modules by prerequisite, each with one tangible win. Confirm the proposed scope before teaching it.
2. **Class:** explain the objective, central relationships, and a distinct worked example. Ask one focused question at a time in normal chat. Clarify without solving the learner's target task.
3. **Practice (optional):** offer Practicar / Omitir once, directly after Class. Reuse a recorded choice on resume; clarification or dismissal never advances the phase. If omitted from Mission, Class or unfinished Practice, preserve actual attempts and move to a brief Consolidation without inventing completed practice. If accepted, set a new application, give one hint at a time, and fade help according to observed performance. Record actual attempts as pending, partial, stuck, or done. Inspect supplied repository evidence only to teach or assess; never modify or solve learner work.
4. **Consolidation:** reuse the learner's real causal explanation and transfer evidence when they meet the rubric. Otherwise ask for their explanation, affirm correct parts, explain the specific gap, and invite a revision. Do not invent a Summary or demand redundant debrief/teach-back rituals. Probe foundational uncertainty selectively.
5. **Close:** require completed or explicitly omitted practice, learner explanation of essential decisions, and no blocking conceptual gaps, with both materials delivered. Topic completion requires real evidence against the agreed mission criteria; no practical capstone is mandatory by default. Skipping exercises does not demonstrate practical competence. Confidence alone proves neither mastery nor retention.

Use stable IDs for the mission's distinct concepts and prerequisites; they order teaching and inform the learner without gating navigation.

Clarification may expand Class or unfinished Practice within its win. After practice is done, place new concepts in separate reinforcement unless the learner explicitly revises the mission; preserve evidence of the practiced scope. A restart or worker result never advances a phase. Generate the note and exercise even when practice is skipped; record omission in existing evidence/status fields and preserve the current paths, sections, columns, and templates. Explicit exercise requests and language input-only/production criteria retain their scope.

## Exercise template

When composing an exercise, use this complete template (same as `assets/exercise-template.md`). Translate headings into the materials language and fill placeholders from supplied inputs.

```markdown
# Exercise — {Name}

> Module: {ID or standalone} · Date: {supplied date or unknown}
> Where: {supplied repository scope or self-contained task}

## Brief

{One new application with a tangible win, distinct from the worked example.}

## Constraints and rubric

- {scope constraint}
- {observable criterion}

## Hints

{Reveal one hint at a time on request. Never include the complete solution.}

## Outcome

- Attempt: pending
- Result: pending
- Learner evidence: pending
- Consolidation: pending; reuse qualifying explanation/transfer evidence
- Blocking gaps: not assessed
```

Fill the Outcome section only from supplied actual evidence and teacher assessment; pending stays pending. Keep literal learner quotes distinct from synthesis.

## Adaptation

- When the learner changes the goal, propose the revised mission and affected module wins together, including downstream requirements. The caller obtains consent and persists the revision. Reassess existing evidence; distinguish retired requirements from resolved gaps and demonstrated competence.
- When prior explanations already cover the goal, reuse them. With explicit omission, assess Consolidation directly from Mission without inventing teaching, practice, or another exercise to prove the same knowledge. Deliver materials before closure.
- When the learner needs another module now, propose deferring the current module and selecting the requested one through the caller. Preserve its phase, attempts, gaps and requirements; materials and closure are not prerequisites for navigation. Explain relevant dependencies briefly and respect the learner's choice. Resume the selected module, not automatically the first unfinished one.

## Output

Return the current teaching step, actual evidence and unresolved gaps, proposed progress, and the next learner action inline. Distinguish proposals from committed state. Use the learner's materials language, defaulting to conversation language; diagrams are purposeful and optional. No sibling calls, project discovery, or implicit writes.
