# Feynman Teach-Back

## Activation

Use a learner explanation to diagnose causal understanding of a supplied concept, especially where understanding is uncertain. Do not turn this into a lecture or require it after equivalent evidence already exists.

## Inputs

Required: concept and reference answer or source material. Optional: learner explanation, prior observations, language, and explicit existing card references. No topic state or cards are necessary.

## Method

Invite the learner to explain to a curious novice. Listen without completing sentences or correcting every phrase mid-explanation. Ask one short question at a time in normal chat, then wait: why a step works, what a term means, or what changes in a new case.

Classify material gaps as missing piece, hand-waved step, wrong claim, or jargon crutch. Ground each finding in the actual explanation and reference. Give specific corrective feedback after the attempt, then let the learner try again.

Use an example, counterexample, or analogy only when it reveals understanding. Never require an analogy regardless of topic. Reuse an existing correct explanation or novel application rather than demand a duplicate ritual.

Agree a focused return path for remaining gaps: a supplied source passage, targeted explanation, or new learner attempt. A mapped card reference permits a proposed review action only; neither a gap nor a fluent answer automatically demotes/promotes cards. Absent cards produce a diagnostic proposal without inventing one.

## Output

Return the observed explanation, questions, classified gaps, suggested return paths, and verdict inline. Use `assets/teachback-template.md` when a structured record is requested. Quote learner evidence faithfully; never claim unobserved delayed retention or invent practical mastery. No sibling calls, state discovery, or writes.
